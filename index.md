<div class = "col-md-9">

I'm extremely passionate about data science and education. In my new role as **Director of Content Partnerships at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)**, I get to work with brilliant people in industry and academia who share my passion and want to create interactive data science courses for hundreds of thousands of students all over the world.

Prior to joining DataCamp, I completed a **masters degree in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University**, then spent a year working on the **Analytics team at McKinsey**.

## Selected adventures

#### swirl (Statistics with Interactive R Learning)

As a graduate student at Johns Hopkins, my primary focus (and the subject of my thesis) was the development of [swirl](http://swirlstats.com).

swirl is a fun and unique software package that teaches data science and R programming. 
Students receive immediate feedback as they are guided through self-paced and interactive lessons, allowing them to quickly master new skills in an authentic programming environment. Since its inception in 2013, **over 300,000 students** worldwide have used swirl to teach themselves R and data science.

#### Data Science Specialization

The [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1) is a groundbreaking sequence of nine MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) we developed at [Johns Hopkins Biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/), all hosted on the Coursera platform. The courses, which are led by my faculty advisers (Brian, Jeff, and Roger), cover all aspects of the data science process and have attracted **over 2,000,000 enrollees** from around the world since 2013.
